# Audio Recognition Algorithm Testing

This repository contains a collection of algorithms to alter audio files of songs. The main objective of this project is to test and evaluate popular audio recognition algorithms, such as Shazam and Musixmatch, by modifying audio clips and inputting them into the algorithms.

## Installation

To use this project, you need to have Python 3 installed. You can install the required dependencies by running the following command:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Running the script
Uncomment the lines at the bottom of script.py based on how you want to alter the audio files that are examined by the audio recognition algorithms. Them, you can run the code with the following command: `python3 main.py`.
